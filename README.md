     ### Landing Page 
     ## This project is a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content sections that are added to the page.  

      the section actively being viewed it has an active class so it can be distinguish from the inactive sections. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump. 
          
     the project use 3  files, 1 html, 1 css and 1 javacsript file.

     ** every new section added  will need to have a new section id and a new data-nav  in order for the navbar to be updated dynamically. **
     (section id="nextSectionId" data-nav="nextDataSet value") example : section id="section6" data-nav="Section 6".
     in order for the code to be able to create a  new dynamic nav bar item.


     ** the Js code is divided in 3 main parts: ** 

      1. dynamically build navbar items.

     2. select active section start (for section and corresponding navbar item).

     3. scroll on click event.
